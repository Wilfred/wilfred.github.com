title: "Attracting and Keeping Developers"
---

A friend of mine has been working in managing developer teams. He
wrote to me recently to ask **how do you attract and keep
developers**?

Whilst I haven't worked in a management role myself, I've worked in
technology companies of different shapes and sizes. I've seen some
approaches work, and some approaches fail miserably.

Firstly, **technology is best viewed as a creative
discipline**. This is explored in the excellent book
[Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams](http://www.amazon.com/Peopleware-Productive-Projects-Second-Edition/dp/0932633439).

With this in mind, what attracts developers? **Developers want to
create**. The best workplace is one where the **team is empowered** and
**able to explore** building the best solutions for the company.

You can usually spot companies that have taken this to heart. Good
positive indicators include:

1. Can developers get their hands dirty with code on the first day?
[Some companies take this so seriously that developers are shown how to commit code before showing them the bathroom](http://www.scottporad.com/2010/11/01/cheezburger-network-doesnt-show-its-new-employees-the-bathroom-until-theyve-checked-in-code/)!

2. Is there a developer team blog? I've never met a developer team
that didn't tackle interesting technical problems. Blog posts show
solutions that have been explored. They are a time investment, but I
suspect that the BBC attracts more front-end developers with
[one blog post on browser testing](http://responsivenews.co.uk/post/18948466399/cutting-the-mustard)
than many job adverts.

3. Does that team have a presence on GitHub? Virtually every developer
  team will be using open source software in some capacity, and
  finding bugs in software is a fact of life. Good developers send
  bugfixes back. Developers will sometimes write little reusable
  libraries or tools, and everyone benefits if they have the freedom
  to release these back to the community.

4. Are the developers given some discretionary time to make things
  better? Google gives its developers 20% time to work on anything
  they want that's vaguely work
  related. [Some companies have 'hackdays'](http://techblog.netflix.com/2014/02/netflix-hack-day.html)
  where the developer team stops normal work and focus on building a
  specific prototype or feature.

Companies giving off these signals find it much easier to attract
people. What makes them stay?

1. Working with smart, friendly people. I've worked at companies where every code change was reviewed by teammates before being merged and deploy. This was a policy we chose, rather than management requesting it. It meant that we knew what each other were working on, we could share knowledge, and it increased camaraderie.

2. Smooth deploy process.
[Etsy sometimes deploy 50 times a day](http://www.slideshare.net/beamrider9/continuous-deployment-at-etsy-a-tale-of-two-approaches)!
  I've never reached that quite that deploy rate, but when it's very
  smooth it's very satisfying to work with. Developers can see their
  changes on the live site, which is satisfying and motivating.

3. Team culture. Great teams have internal mailing lists, an internal
  chat room (typically IRC or a [HipChat](https://www.hipchat.com/))
  and an internal wiki. These contribute to a shared identity, a
  shared culture, and a shared knowledgebase. Developers are more reluctant
  to leave companies when they feel part of it.

4. Acceptable pay. Whilst I believe the previous issues are often more
  important, staff will leave if there is a significant pay
  difference.

A team that's inspired, empowered and free to experiment with solving
problems to the best of their ability. That's what technology is about.
