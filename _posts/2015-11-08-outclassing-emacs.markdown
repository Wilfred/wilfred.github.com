title: "Outclassing Emacs"
---

Software comes and goes, platforms change, use cases are adapted for
contemporary usage.

Somehow, Emacs has outlived everything. In an industry that's
continually reinventing itself, it's incredible that a 1976 text
editor is still in active use.

What can Emacs teach us about the design of programming tools? What
tools will surpass Emacs in the very areas it excels in?

In this blog post, I will explore Emacs' strengths, weaknesses, and
then look at newer, more potent competitors.

## Inspect Editor At Point



## Just a REPL Really

## Emacs Ecosystem

## Emacs Limitations

## Victory of the commons: Atom

Amazing ecosystem, proper package manager. GitHub team know how to
build community projects.

Leveraging the HTML/CSS/JS developer community: many devs, but
sometimes performance suffers. Very cutting edge too: used react, then
native, trying to use the Electron tooling to best effect. Interesting
experiment, exploring the limits of the web platform.

Not just text: great colour pickers, markdown renderers etc.

Not very introspectable, but latest release adds good descriptions of
settings: http://blog.atom.io/2015/10/29/atom-1-1-is-out.html
('Settings Have Nice Descriptions')

Requires a separate master/slave editor rather than interactive
inplace changes.

## Meta Editing: Pharo

Very introspectable.

Maturing: moving away from Scratch's UI, better software engineering
(cf scratch being removed by gentoo for libjpeg vulnerabilities).

## Closing Thoughts
