title: "Exploring Rust"
---

Rust recently released 1.0, and it's a perfect time to see what the
language has to offer.

I decided to implement a link checker that would crawl a website and
report any broken URLs. You can find the
[final project on GitHub](https://github.com/Wilfred/linkdoc).

## Cargo

Nothing like it in any other systems language.

## Rust is amazingly polished

rust play can run from any example in the docs

docs are generally good

## The community is brilliant

Merged a fix for my bug.

## Rust is still immature

Needed to use nightly

majority of stack overflow answers no longer compile

no easy to way to do timeouts is causing problems

several of my dependencies, even though they were mozilla/servo deps,
were not yet on crates.io.

## There's a huge learning curve

Writing a Unique iterator took a lot of head scratching, two IRC
questions and one SO question.

## Resulting programs are excellent

Fast, robust.

The future looks extremely bright.
