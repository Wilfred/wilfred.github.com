As I reach the one year mark of Python programming, I still find things that make my life easier. Things I wish I'd known earlier. Here are those little tricks of the trade I've picked up:
<h2>Shelling Out</h2>
The basic Python shell is pretty limited. There are a few shortcuts worth learning:

1. If you want to access your last result, it's saved the '_' variable.
<pre lang="python">>>> 2 * 5
10
>>> _ + 1 # the underscore variables holds the last used result
11</pre>

2. <code>help()</code> also works for imported modules and packages. If you don't know where a module is being imported from, just call <code>help()</code> on it. This saves you poking through <code>sys.path</code>.

<pre lang="python">>>> import lxml
>>> help(lxml)
Help on package lxml:

NAME
    lxml - # this is a package

FILE
    /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/lxml/__init__.py

PACKAGE CONTENTS
    ElementInclude
    _elementpath
    builder
    cssselect
    doctestcompare
    etree
    html (package)
    objectify
    pyclasslookup
    sax
    usedoctest
</pre>

Still, for day-to-day development you can do so much better. There are two major third-party shells, bpython and ipython.

Bpython is a curses-based Python interpreter with syntax colouring and pop-up help. It also saves history <em>between</em> sessions. You won't want to go back to the normal interpreter.

Ipython is also a very popular shell. It largely offers the same features as bpython, but also has fantastic line completion. If you previously typed in <code>function_with_long_name(foo, bar)</code>, you can just type in <code>func</code> and press up, allowing you to move through every previous line that started with func.

Personally, I stick to bpython as Ipython can be frustratingly buggy at times. Unicode support is particularly poor.

Both shells are just an <code>$ easy_install bpython</code> or <code>$ easy_install ipython</code> away.

<h2>Python 3 is a-comin'</h2>
Python 3 offers many advantages over Python 2.X, but many libraries don't support it yet. Web frameworks are beginning to catch up, but it will be a few months before you can Django et al without Python 2. Use Python 3 when you can, but check in advance what your dependencies need.

If in doubt, use Python 2 and use the <code>2to3</code> tool to make sure your code is easily ported to Python 3.

<h2>Learn your pitfalls</h2>

Python has relatively few sharp edges, but there are a few to be aware of:

1. Mutable objects for default arguments.
<pre lang="python">>>> def f(l=[]):
...     l.append(0)
...     return l
...
...
>>> f()
[0]
>>> f()
[0, 0]
</pre>

2. Variable scope is only delimited by function blocks.
<pre lang="python">>>> def f():
...     for i in range(10):
...         pass
...
...     print i
...
...
>>> f()
9</pre>

3. Variable declaration is implicit.

<pre lang="python">>>> x = 1
>>> def f():
...     x = x + 1
...
...
>>> f()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
  File "<input>", line 2, in f
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'x' referenced before assignment
</pre>

4. Division is integer division by default (fixed in Python 3).
<pre lang="python">>>> 1 / 3
0
>>> 1.0 / 3
0.3333333333333333
>>> from __future__ import division # / becomes floating point, // becomes integer division
>>> 1 / 3
0.3333333333333333
>>> 1 // 3
0</pre>

5. Types can change behind your back.

<pre lang="python">>>> '1' > 2
True
</pre>

<h2>env is your friend</h2>

It is tempting to write #!/usr/bin/python at the top of scripts, but this assumes that a Python interpreter is available in that directory. It's safer to write #!/usr/bin/env python.

<h2>pip: easy_install done right</h2>

As you get more experienced with Python, you will find that the standard library doesn't always meet you needs. The <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi">Python Package Index (PyPI)</a> offers a broad range of libraries to help you Get Stuff Done. You can simply use <code>easy_install</code> to install packages, but <code>pip</code> (available on PyPI) is far more capable. For example, it includes an uninstall feature, which easy_install lacks.

<h2>virtualenv: Solving library grief</h2>

Sooner or later, you will try to to run two different pieces of code that have mutually incompatible dependencies. In these situations, <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv/1.5.1">virtualenv</a> will save you. It allows you to set up different environments with different library selections. You can then easily flick between environments as your needs change.
<h2>pyflakes keeps you honest</h2>
There are a number of static analysis code tools on PyPI, but <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyflakes/0.4.0">pyflakes</a> is a must-have. It will pick up on unused imports, unused variables, syntax errors and other things, all of which keep your code clean and well-behaved.

That concludes today's braindump. I hope it's useful.
