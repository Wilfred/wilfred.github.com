title: "Difftastic: The Algorithmic Diff"
---

Once you have parse trees, you need to work out which nodes have
changed.

## What do we want?

A diff that is syntactically accurate, minimal, fast, and comprehensible.

## Academic research

Minimal diff and runtime perf.

Not displaying diffs, which reveals a bunch of other issues.

Gumtree exists.

Optimal isn't sufficient. Comments should be treated
differently. Multiple vallid solutions.

## Lisp Projects

There was a talk at a conference. Autochrome. Some CL folks discussed
it.

## Line Diffing

Performance is crucial here too.
