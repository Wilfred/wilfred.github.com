title: "The Different Flavours of Syntax Highlighting"
---

What do you expect your editor to highlight? What are the different
ways that we can highlight code? There are some common solutions, but
there are a variety of options.

The limitation of highlighting tools is that you can't use all of them
at the same time. We'll explore what's available to help you choose.

I'm taking these examples from Emacs, but many of these are available
on other editors too.

## Lexical Highlighting

Standard.

## Semantic Highlighting

js2-mode showing globals and 

## S-expression Highlighting

Current s-expression.

Nested s-expression.
